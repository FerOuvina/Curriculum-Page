                <p class="aboutMe__p1">Hi I'm Fernando Ouvi&#241a, I am a Front-End Developer in process. I started
                    learning web development almost a year ago. I have learned
                    HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript well and I have a strong base of
                    Programming Logic. Right now I'm studying React to have a
                    strong set of technologies</p>
        
                <p class="aboutMe__p2">I made several projects implementing Responsive Design,
                    LocalStorage API, React useState, useEffect, React components,
                    version control with Git, and I've made use of Animations with the
                    Gsap Library.</p>
        
                <p class="aboutMe__p3">Every day I continue learning through challenges and projects,
                    and I would like to get my first opportunity in the workplace to put
                    everything I know into practice in real projects and be able to
                    continue learning from my colleagues as well as continuing to
                    grow myself and provide great value to the company.</p>
